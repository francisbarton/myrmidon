#' @title Wrapper to simplify download.file
#'
#' Sometimes you just want to call download.file and not have to specify
#' the name of the destination file. You just want the local file to be the same
#' as the remote file that forms the basename of the URL.
#'
#' Default setting for dir is "" which means file will end up in project root
#' directory (according to `here()`).
#'
#' destfile we want to extract from the URL using `basename` but we need to offer
#' it as an argument to the function anyway because the user might want or need
#' to specify it, as you do with `download.file` eg if it turns out destfile
#' already exists.
#'
#' User can specify `overwrite = TRUE` which will allow the file to be downloaded
#' even if the target already exists.
#'
#' @name download_file
#'
#' @import utils
#' @importFrom here here
#' @importFrom usethis ui_stop
#'
#' @param url URL to download. Passed to `download.file()`.
#' @param dir (optional) Directory to download to.
#' Defaults to project root folder/working directory.
#' @param destfile (optional) Name of local file to download to.
#' The whole point of this is not to have to specify a destfile,
#' but if you want or need to, you can. Passed to `download.file()`.
#' @param overwrite (optional) Force allow overwrite of existing local destfile.
#' I haven't checked whether `download.file()` will actually do this in the end, though.
#' @param ... Any other arguments you want to pass through to `download.file()`, such as
#' mode, method, headers, quiet and so on.
#'
#' @return None
